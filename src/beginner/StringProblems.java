public class StringProblems {

    // 1. Write a method that checks if two strings are equal, case sensitive.
    // (ex: "test" & "test" -> true; "Test" & "TEST" -> false; "TeSt" & "tEsT -> false; "TeSt" & "TeSt" -> true)

    // 2. Write a method that checks if two strings are equal, case insensitive.
    // (ex: "test", "test" -> true; "Test", "TEST" -> true; "TeSt" & "tEsT -> true; "TeSt" & "TeSt" -> true)

    // 3. Write a method that returns the first and last character of a given string, respectively.
    // (ex: "Brown" -> {'B', 'n'}; "monkey1" -> {'m', '1'})

    // 4. Write a method that checks if the length of a string is greater than or equal to 3.
    // (ex: "Uh" -> false; "Auditorium" -> true; "Man" -> true);

    // 5. Write a method that returns the number of words from a given string. Assume each word is separated by a space.
    // (ex: "This is a sample string" -> 5; "But why?" -> 2; "I cannot wait to go home and lay on my bed" -> 11)

    // 6. Write a method that returns the first three characters of a given string. Be wary about an edge case.

    // 7. Write a method that returns the last three characters of a given string. Be wary about an edge case.

    // 8. Write a method that concatenates the first and last three characters of a given string. Be wary about an edge case.

    // 9. Write a method that checks if the given string contains numerical values.

    // 10. Write a method that checks if the given string contains alphabetical characters.

    // 11. Write a method that will remove vowels from a given string.

    // 12. Write a method that returns the number of words from a given string.

    // 13. Write a method that returns the number of words from a file.

    // 14. Write a method that checks if a string is a palindrome.

    // 15. Write a method that checks if two strings are an anagram.

    // 16. Write a method that checks if a string contains duplicate characters.
